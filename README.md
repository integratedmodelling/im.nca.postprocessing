This repository hosts a series of modules with methods for post-processing NCA-related data produced with ARIES. 

## Contents of the repository

- ***aggregation_region*** hosts modules implementing methods to aggregate by region the values of rasters describing a density observable (i.e. quantity per unit area).

- ***map_comparison*** hosts modules implementing methods for rasters' comparison with multiple spatial statistics. At the moment only the Structural Similarity Index Metric (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity) is available.
